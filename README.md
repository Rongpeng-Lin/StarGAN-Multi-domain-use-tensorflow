## Description
&#8195;1.If you are doing a multi-dataset conversion task (this example is to convert on two datasets), you need two description files in txt format, like:<br>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;5_o_Clock_Shadow&#8195;Arched_Eyebrows&#8195;Attractive&#8195;Bags_Under_Eyes&#8195;Bald<br>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;000001.jpg&#8195;&#8195;-1&#8195;&#8195;1&#8195;&#8195;1&#8195;&#8195;-1<br>&#8195;2.To perform more domain conversion tasks(three or more), as described in the paper, you can add 'txt_dir', 'features', 'imfile' to the source code.<br>&#8195;3.You can add gradient penalties or other GAN models, which can be achieved with easy code changes.<br>&#8195;4.discourse address:[https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09020)
